# 📖 Description

The project follows Object Oriented Programming using `Ruby`.
This repository includes ten class files (`Person` / `Student` / `Teacher` / `Classroom` / `Book` / `Rental` / `Nameable` / `Decorator` / `Capitalize` / `Trimmer`).
Special class `App` for handling all app operations and a file `main.rb` as entry point for it.
Project follows `SOLID` concepts and (`DRY` / `YAGNI` / `KISS`) principles.
Decorator design pattern is implemented for adding several operations on `name` variable in `Person` class.
Several associations exist bewteen some classes.

📌 **Tech Stack:**
- Code built with `Ruby`
- Linting is done with `Rubocop`

📌 **Key Features:**
- Class `Nameable` is a parent class for both `Person` & `Decorator`
- Class `Person` is a parent class for both `Student` & `Teacher`
- Class `Decorator` is a parent class for both `Capitalize` & `Trimmer`
- Class `Person` includes a constructor & four methods
- Constructor in `Person` class includes three arguments (`age` / `name` / `parent_permission`)
- First method in `Person` class is a public method called `add_rental`
- Second method in `Person` class is a public method called `can_use_services`
- Third method in `Person` class is an unherited method called `correct_name`
- Fourth method in `Person` class is a private method called `of_age`
- Class `Student` includes a constructor & two method
- Constructor in `Student` class includes three arguments (`classroom` / `age` / `name` / `parent_permission`)
- First method in `Student` class is a public method called `play_hooky`
- Second method in `Student` class is a static method called `input_arguments`
- Constructor in `Teacher` class includes three arguments (`specialization` / `age` / `name` / `parent_permission`)
- First method in `Teacher` class is a public method that overrides `can_use_services` from parent class
- Second method in `Teacher` class is a static method called `input_arguments`
- Class `Nameable` includes one method `correct_name` that raises an exception
- Class `Decorator` includes only constructor that passes a `Nameable` object
- Class `Capitalize` includes one inherited method `correct_name` & overrides it
- Class `Trimmer` includes one inherited method `correct_name` & overrides it
- Class `Classroom` includes a constructor & one method
- Constructor in `Classroom` includes one argument `label`
- Only method in `Classroom` class is public method `add_student`
- Class `Book` includes a constructor & one method
- Constructor in `Book` includes two arguments (`title` / `author`)
- Only method in `Book` class is public method `add_rental`
- Class `Rental` includes only one constructor & one method
- Only method in `Rental` class is a static method called `input_arguments`
- Constructor in `Book` includes three arguments (`date` / `book` / `person`)
- Only method in `Book` class is a static method called `input_arguments`
- Class `App` includes a constructor & twelve methods
- Constructor in `App` initializes several empty arrays
- Entry point in `main.rb` file with infinite loop
